function [Q,R] = house_qr(A)
%
%    This function computes the QR factorization of a general real matrix
%  A by Householder reflections.

% Get the size of the matrix and set the number of steps.

[n m] = size(A);
if (m < n)
  steps = m;
else
  steps = n-1;
end

% Copy A to the working matrix R, and initialize Q.

R = A;
Q = eye(n);

% The main loop that reduces column by column.

for j=1:steps

  % Compute the Householder vector for the current column with get_house.
  v = get_house(R(:,j),j,n);

  % Apply the transformation, that is compute R = H*R.
  R = R - v*(v'*R);

  % Force zeros in the places that should be zero but for rounding error.
  for i=j+1:n
    R(i,j) = 0;
  end

  % Apply the Householder reflection to Q from the right, Q = Q*H'.
  Q = Q - (Q*v)*v';
